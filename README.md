This program is used to add tags to files and folders on Dropbox, based on keywords found in the filenames.

There are two python scripts here, one of which is used for running on personal folders, and the other is used for shared team folders.

You can edit the keywords you'd like to search for, as well as the resulting tags. Multiple keywords can be included in an array.
